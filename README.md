# time-out
A Chrome Extension designed to help you be more productive!

This chrome extension is made to help users be more productive by ensuring users don't spend too much time on any given website.
For example, a user can enter the website 'www.youtube.com', and block the all pages on the website for 30 minutes every 15 minutes. Therfore, users can specify exactly how long they want to work for and how long they want their breaks to last. 
Users can also view their most frequented websites since the installation of the chrome extension and the total amount of time they've spent on each website.
